##Terminal-like UI
This is for my personal website <a href="borderliner.ir" target="_blank">borderliner.ir</a>. I wanted to make my website look like terminal, and I created an interface that somehow resembles it. Nothing needed to run it, except a webserver, because it reads the text from an external file and it needs a webserver to run, otherwise you may face some errors.
