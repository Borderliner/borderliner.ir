##Terminal-like UI
This is for my personal website <a href="http://borderliner.ir">borderliner.ir</a>. I wanted to make my website look like a terminal, so I created a UI that somehow resembles it. Nothing is needed to run it, except a webserver, because it reads the main text from an external file and it needs a webserver to be executed, otherwise you may face some errors.
